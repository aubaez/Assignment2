    "### Conclusion for A2.2:\n",
    "After implementing the system in A2.1, the next system design update was to randomize the eating and napping time.  To do this, I included the random library to use function random.randint.  This function generates random values between int value a, b .  A design consideration for this was to add boundaries to the random eating/napping times, such that eating time and napping time did not cause a deadlock in the starving state.  For this I chose values between 40 and 80 for eating time and  10 and 20 for napping time."
